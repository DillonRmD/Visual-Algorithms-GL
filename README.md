## Visual Algorithms - Dillon Williams 2021

Visual Algorithms is a project that I work on in my free time outside of school and work, whenever that is. 
The goal of the project is to, from the ground up, create an application that visualizes different sorting algorithms through a handful of rectangles.
The code currently uses OpenGL, Win32 API, and my personal API [dtb](https://github.com/DillonRmD/dtb) for math and window context creation/handling.
